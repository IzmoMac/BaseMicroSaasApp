I started this project as a hobby, I just thought it would be cool to have a proper way to log your drives and fillups (Yes I know that there are propably similar projects or apps already)

The repository name is BaseMicroSaasApp because at first I just wanted to create a nice template which I could use for any project I use, and I wanted to learn React since my main experience is with C# and .NET, I first started by vibe coding it, and then after I did not understand what was going on with the code (it used a lot of different packages that were alien to me). And I could barely understand the syntax.

So then I decided to put this project on pause and went and read the whole React documentation and that helped a lot.
I wanted to do it with only React features to understand React fully, and then I used chapgpt to generate the tailwindcss for me. 

After the first version was done, I stumbled upon what react router is, which I really pulled the whole thing together.

For hosting I have a linux VPS and created it. In that I have more experience in, and with the help of chatgpt I was able to create the ci/cd pipeline syntax for github actions
